# ⚖️ Calories Tracker ![CI](https://github.com/noeldemartin/calories-tracker/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Calories Tracker is a _Personal App_, powered by [Aerogel](https://aerogel.js.org) and the [Solid Protocol](https://solidproject.org).

## What is a "Personal App"?

A Personal App is something I've made for myself, and I don't expect anyone else to use. You are welcome to look at the code though, and even use the app yourself, but keep in mind that it comes with no guarantees (even less than usual with Open Source).

Because of that, I don't even have issues enabled in this repository. But you are welcome to open discussions, and feel free to ping me if you have any questions.

Something else that distinguishes this from a "real" app is my attention to detail. I'm a lot more lenient here, and I don't pay much attention to things like accessibility (which I would otherwise).
